## Introduction

It includes six widgets:
- Profit report

The next sections explain what each widget means and how it can be useful to monitor your delivery company.

## Profit Report

The profit report allows you to extract a pdf document that summarises the profit of the company over a specific period of time.

To generate a profit report, specify the start and end date, then click **GENERATE REPORT**\
As soon as the report is generated, you will see a download button which you can click to download and view the profit report.
